These people have entrusted me with their files so I have some guidelines of what you can do with these files 
1. You can use them as refernece to help improve your roooms
2. You can connect to that region but you still have to get their premission
3. You cannot edit a room massivly and release it just because the files are here, don't ruin other peoples hard work 
Also if you break any of these rules there will be consequences 
The main thing is you ask for premission before doing anything with someone else's property
