- To install **level editor projects**, you need to download the **LevelEditorProjects** folder from the github repository and place its content into your **local LevelEditorProjects folder** (found in the same folder as the editor executable).
- To use the blank you put them into you main project folder for easy access.
Once you name the level the blank will remain the same but the level will 
then be called whatever you named it 
Also don't delete the blanks or you will be sad
